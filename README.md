# PupilAnalysis
### Under contruction

PupilAnalysis is a code developed in the R platform for pupil signal processing.
This code requires a database (.csv), which in our research was obtained through an eye tracking device (Tobii TX300).

This code shows how to do:
- Preprocessing;
- Variance Analysis;
- Statistical significance teste;
- Average curve of the pupil sign.

In addition, after pre-processing step, the [PCA and MLDA](https://github.com/IPL-FEI/SiProcess) can be used for feature extraction.

PCA and MLDA direct in R (coming soon)
